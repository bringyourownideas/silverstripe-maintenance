## Overview

The [SilverStripe Maintenance module](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-maintenance "Assists with the
maintenance of your SilverStripe application") reduces your maintenance related work.

## Requirements

* Requires the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to be available and readable in the environment you plan to use this module. All information is based on these files.
* The [queuedjobs module](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs) updates metadata on your installed modules in the background. You need to [configure](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs) it to run those jobs.
* For the optional update checkers, the webserver environment needs to be able to contact external information sources through network requests
* SilverStripe:
  * Maintenance ^2.2: SilverStripe ^4.4
  * Maintenance ~2.1.0: SilverStripe 4.0-4.3
  * Maintenance: ^1.0: SilverStripe 3.x

### Suggested Modules

By default, the module will read your installed modules,
and present them as a report in the CMS under `admin/reports`.

In order to get information about potential updates to these modules,
we recommend the installation of the following additional modules:

- [bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-update-checker](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-update-checker) checks for available updates of dependencies
- [bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker) checks for known security vulnerabilities

### Installation

Option 1 (recommended): Install the maintenance package and suggested dependencies

```
composer require bringyourownideas/silverstripe-maintenance bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-update-checker
```

Option 2 (minimal): Install only the maintenance package without any update checks

```
composer require bringyourownideas/silverstripe-maintenance
```

Build schema and queue an initial job to populate the database:

```
sake dev/build
```

If you haven't already, you need to [configure the job queue](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs)
to update module metadata in the background. By default, this happens every day,
but can be configured to run at different intervals through YAML config:

```yaml
BringYourOwnIdeas\Maintenance\Jobs\CheckForUpdatesJob:
  reschedule_delay: '+1 hour'
```

### Manually running tasks

By default, tasks are run through a job queue. You can also choose to manually refresh via the command line.

Run the update task (includes the [update-checker](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-update-checker))
```
sake dev/tasks/UpdatePackageInfoTask
```

Run the security update check task (requires the [security-checker](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker))

```
sake dev/tasks/SecurityAlertCheckTask
```


## How your composer.json influences the report

The report available through the CMS shows "Available" and "Latest" versions (see [user guide](docs/en/userguide/index.md)).
The version recommendations in those columns depend on your
`composer.json` configuration. When setting tight constraints (e.g. `silverstripe/framework:4.3.2@stable`),
newer releases don't show up as expected. We recommend to have looser constraints by default
(e.g. `silverstripe/framework:^4.3`). When the "Latest" version shows `dev-master`,
it likely means that you have `"minimum-stability": "dev"` in your `composer.json`.
